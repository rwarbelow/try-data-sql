  h2 What to expect
  p Over the course of the day, we will learn how to write SQL statements to query datasets and answer data questions using a comination of Python and SQL. We will ask you to introduce yourself, ask questions, and occasionally share out answers to the technical work we do! Below is our agenda for the day (all times in MST):
  ul
    li 15 min - Welcome and Introduction, and Instruction.
    li 75 min - Instruction.
    li 30 min - Break and Turing School information.
    li 75 min - Instruction
    li 15 min - Wrap Up and Questions

  h2 Learning Norms
  ol
    li No question is too small. No question is a bad question. Ask them! Type into the group chat box and a TA will answer you. Avoid direct messages to a TA unless it is a specific issue only to yourself.
    li We all benefit from each others ideas! Push yourself to share out and make sure you aren't sharing so much that others don't have the space to do so.
    li Mute yourself unless you're talking.
    li Keep your camera on during class and breakout sessions; ok to turn off during independent work time
    li Disconnected? Jump back on! If the host or TAs get disconnected, hold tight, and the session will resume shortly.
    li You might be sharing your screen with your team at some point during the class -- if you have anything open that you don't want to accidentally share, close or minimize it now.
